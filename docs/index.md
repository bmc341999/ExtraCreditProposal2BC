        <h1>Map Proposal</h1>
        
        <p>
            There are many people who live in poverty, especially in the Appalachian region. This can make obtaining food and other necessities difficult for these people. Luckily, there are programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program(SNAP), which provides impoverished people with monetary assistance in order to put food of the table. Many of these households have children that do not get an adequate amount of food each day. This especially holds true during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, thousands of households have felt the financial impacts, a lot of the times in the form of unemployment. This crisis puts an even greater burden on the impoverished Appalachian households who already struggle to get by without the added effects of a pandemic.

            <li>
                
                <i class="heading">The Purpose of the Map:</i> This mapâ€™s intended purpose is to determine the relationship between the number of people who use SNAP, their income and the number of children in the household in the counties of South East Ohio. The intended audience of this map would be people such as the Athens Community Food Initiative or other similar groups. My goal with this map is to see the connections between how many SNAP users have children and how their income may determine that. I would like to include tabs on the map that would cycle through the different variables since displaying them all at once may make them look cluttered.

            <li>
                <i class="heading">The Structure of the Map:</i> All layers will be mapped at the county level. The SNAP layer would be visualized using the graduated colors technique. This would display counties with more SNAP users as a darker color. The income layer would be visualized using the graduated symbols technique. Households with higher incomes would be shown is a larger symbol. The number of households that have children would be displayed using the dot density technique. Counties that have more SNAP households with children will be shown with more dots in that county. Supplementary data would be provided to the map user using popups connected to each county. These popups would contain information pertaining to the percent of SNAP users who live in poverty and the number of households who have 0, 1, or 2+ workers. People who live in poverty have a greater chance of being people who use SNAP and other assistance programs. Knowing the number of workers in the household can make it easier to understand how much money each individual person makes.

            <li>
                <i class="heading">Data Sources:</i> All the data for this project would be retrieved from the US Census Bureau website. Each variable will be found in its respective table for each county on the Census website. The 2018 5-year ACS estimate tables will be used to maintain consistency across all variables. The data for the geometry of the counties will come from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) website, which was last updated December 17, 2019. 
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
                <i class="heading">Methodology:</i> For the data collection phase, the poverty data, income data, and the number of children per household using SNAP data would be pulled out from their respective Census data tables for each county of South East Ohio and compiled into a separate table that would allow me to organize the data for this project. The data processing phase consists of this table being joined with the attribute table of the ODOT county layers, which provides the geometry for each county. Only the information of the relevant counties will be kept. This information would then be visualized in ArcGIS Online. Each variable will be displayed in the format described above. To add interactivity, popups would be created and filled with the poverty and number of workers information.  
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
                <i class="heading">Timeframe:</i> To begin, on October 14th to October 23 I will collect the data for each of my variables as well as the data that contains the county geometry. From October 26 to November 6, will be the data processing phase where I will manipulate the data into a usuable form and combine the variables' attribute data with the geometry. From November 9 to November 13 will be the period where I begin to make visualization choices that are appropiate for the types of variables I am using. From November 16 to November 20, that will be when I add the interactivity elements to the map. From November 19 to December 3, that will be the polishing and revision stage where I incorporate feedback into the map in order to improve upon it.
